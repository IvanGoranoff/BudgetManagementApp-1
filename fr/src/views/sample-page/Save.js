      Saving is a crucial aspect of sound financial management. It&apos;s recommended to set aside at least 20% of your income for savings. This practice not only prepares you for unforeseen circumstances but also helps in building a future financial cushion. Whether it&apos;s for retirement, a major purchase, or an emergency fund, saving consistently ensures you&apos;re financially prepared for the future. Remember, savings can start small and grow over time. The key is consistency and commitment to your financial goals. By setting aside a portion of your income regularly, you&apos;re paving the way for financial security and peace of mind.
